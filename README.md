## Why Nog?

It was an easy name forming from NeoVim and Blog, and I came up with the idea
around Christmas time.

## How do I Set This Up?

To use Nog, you'll need a website of your own with your own domain.
You'll connect via and http request to keep things easy, then you'll
need an API endpoint for publishing and editing. This is still
in progress so more details will come shortly.
